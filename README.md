## Accessibility

This web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

## User Story
As a marketing agency
we wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards
So that our own site is optimized for search engines.
